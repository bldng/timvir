# Code

The `<Code>` component provides syntax highlighting for code blocks.

<Exhibit bleed={24}>
  <Code language="jsx">
    <Sample variant="basic" as="source" />
  </Code>
</Exhibit>

And this is how that code looks when rendered:

<Exhibit bleed={24}>
  <Sample variant="basic" language="javascript" />
</Exhibit>

The default language is "markdown", but you can specify any of the languages
which are supported by [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

<Exhibit bleed={24} caption="Language: javascript">
  <Code language="javascript">
    const answer = 42;
  </Code>
</Exhibit>
