# Code

The `<Code>` component provides syntax highlighting for code blocks.

<Code language="jsx">
  <Sample variant="basic" as="source" />
</Code>

And this is how that code looks when rendered:

<Sample variant="basic" language="javascript" />

The default language is "markdown", but you can specify any of the languages
which are supported by [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

<Code language="javascript">
  const answer = 42;
</Code>
