# ColorContrastInspector

The `<ColorContrastInspector>` displays a matrix of foreground and background colors. For each combination,
the minimum opacity that the foreground color needs to have in order to satisfy a contrast ratio
(eg. WCAG recommendations for normal and large texts).

The background colors are shown as columns, the foreground colors as rows. The assumption is that you will have
fewer background colors than foreground colors, as it's easier to expand the matrix downwards. Only up to about
six background colors are supported.
