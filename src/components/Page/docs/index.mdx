# Page

The `<Page>` component establishes the page layout (sidebar, center), and wraps the content in a `<MDXProvider>` so
that the page MDX elements are correctly styled.

The layout is currently based on CSS grid with three columns:

 * A center column for the main content. It has a maximum width that is suited for regular text.
 * The two remaining columns have equal width and are placed on the left and right side of the center column.

All children are by default placed in the center column. In order to place an element into different columns, import one of the predefined class namess from the `@timvir/page` package and apply them to your element:

```
import { fullWidth } from "@timvir/page"

<div className={fullWidth}>
  This element will span across all columns.
</div>
```

import { fullWidth } from "../layout"

<div className={fullWidth} style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center", height: 100, background: "teal", color: "white" }}>
  This element will span across all columns.
</div>
