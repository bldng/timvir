# Exhibit

The `<Exhibit>` is a block which is used to present something–usually a React component–in a nice way. It's a way to say:

<Exhibit caption={`Explain what the exhibit is all about.`}>
  <div style={{ height: 40, padding: "0 16px", background: "teal", color: "white", display: "flex", alignItems: "center" }}>
    Hey, look here, look at my beauty!
  </div>
</Exhibit>

Think of it as a `<figure>` + `<figcaption>` for React components.

Make the source accessible if you think it is important to see the code that is used to create the exhibit:

<Exhibit
  source={`<button>Do Not Click Me!</button>`}
  caption={`Exhibit with source code.`}
>
  <button>Do Not Click Me!</button>
</Exhibit>

Add a title to the exhibit if it helps the reader to understand the exhibit better. The title is placed snuggly to the exhibit.

<Exhibit
  title="This Is Not A Button"
  caption="It's an input element, of type text"
>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Type something…" style={{ boxSizing: "border-box", width: "100%", padding: 8 }} />
</Exhibit>
