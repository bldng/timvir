# Timvir

## What is Timvir?

Timvir has many faces. First it is a **convention**. An unwritten specification how to name components, where to place them within the project folder, how to manage them, how to document them etc. Second, it is a collection of **commandline tools** and **components** which aim to make the aforementioned easier.

## Stage

The current focus is on:

 - Integrate timvir into a few projects to find out whether the conventions makes sense.
 - Improve the rough edges in the commandline tool, make common operations easy to execute.
 - Expand the set of components based on the users needs when writing documentation pages.
