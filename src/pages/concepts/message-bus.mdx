# Message Bus

Components on each Timvir page have access to a page-wide message bus. This bus provides
a standardized communication channel so that components can communicate with each
other. The main purpose is to allow implementing micro-interactions that combine multiple
components on a page.

The format of the messages is inspired by [D-Bus](dbus.freedesktop.org).

The bus uses [wonka](https://wonka.kitten.sh/) (a streams/observable library) internally. Components
can subscribe to all messages that are sent to the bus, optionally filter them to receive
only those they are interested in.

## API

The wonka [Subject](https://wonka.kitten.sh/api/sources#makesubject) is stored in a React Context.
To access it use the `useContext()` function from `@timvir/core`.

```typescript
import { useContext } from "@timvir/core";

function Component() {
  const { bus } = useContext();
}
```

Once you have access to the bus, you can subscribe to the messages. The following example
stores the last message in local React state.

```typescript
import * as React from "react";
import { useContext } from "@timvir/core";
import { pipe, subscribe } from "wonka";

function Component() {
  const { bus } = useContext();

  const [message, setMessage] = React.useState();
  React.useEffect(() => pipe(bus.source, subscribe(setMessage)).unsubscribe, [bus]);
}
```
